ðŸŽ¯ Day 3 â€“ One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

ðŸ§© Excel VLOOKUP & XLOOKUP comparison

Using a FIFA 21 player dataset, I compared how VLOOKUP and XLOOKUP handle real-world inconsistencies â€” like names with extra spaces (e.g., " Lionel Messi" instead of "Lionel Messi").

âœ… VLOOKUP failed â€” exact match required, and no easy way to trim the lookup array.

âœ… XLOOKUP handled it cleanly, thanks to its support for nesting functions like TRIM()

I also showed how XLOOKUP can return multiple values at once, which VLOOKUP simply canâ€™t do.

ðŸ§  Takeaway: XLOOKUP is not just a replacement for VLOOKUP â€” itâ€™s a much more flexible and powerful tool for working with real-world data.
